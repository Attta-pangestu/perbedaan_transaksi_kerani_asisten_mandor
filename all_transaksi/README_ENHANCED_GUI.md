# Enhanced GUI Ifess Analysis Tool v3.0

## Overview
Enhanced GUI application for comprehensive FFB employee performance analysis with advanced reporting capabilities. This version integrates all the enhanced functionality from the standalone script into a user-friendly graphical interface.

## New Features in v3.0

### 🔧 Enhanced Analysis Engine
- **Dual Verification Logic**: 
  - Method 1: Status code 704 recognition as VERIFIED
  - Method 2: Multiple records detection (same TRANSNO+TRANSDATE)

  - PM = KERANI (Plantation Manager)
  - P1 = ASISTEN (Assistant)
  - P5 = MANDOR (Supervisor)
  - Fallback to name-based detection
- **Comprehensive Status Mapping**: Integration with LOOKUP table for accurate status interpretation
- **Enhanced Division Integration**: Proper JOIN operations with OCFIELD and CRDIVISION tables

### 📊 Advanced Reporting System
#### 1. 4-Sheet Excel Reports
- **Sheet 1 - Detail Karyawan**: Individual employee performance with comprehensive metrics
- **Sheet 2 - Summary Role**: Aggregated statistics by employee role
- **Sheet 3 - Summary Divisi**: Division-level performance analysis
- **Sheet 4 - Breakdown Status**: Detailed status code distribution per employee

#### 2. Professional PDF Reports

- Role-based performance analysis
- Top performer rankings
- Professional formatting with tables and charts

#### 3. Advanced Visualization Charts
- 2x3 chart layout with comprehensive analysis
- Employee verification rates (top 15)
- Transaction volume analysis
- Role distribution pie charts
- Division performance metrics
- Color-coded performance indicators (Green ≥80%, Orange ≥60%, Red <60%)

### 🎯 Enhanced User Interface
#### New Reports Tab
- Dedicated reporting interface with status monitoring
- Real-time progress tracking
- Comprehensive feature overview
