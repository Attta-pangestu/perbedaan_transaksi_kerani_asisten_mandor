## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### Updated Query Structure
```sql
-- Corrected date range for April 2025
WHERE b.DIVID = '{div_id}'
    AND a.RECORDTAG = 'PM'
    AND a.TRANSDATE >= '2025-04-01' 
    AND a.TRANSDATE < '2025-04-28'  -- KEY CORRECTION
```

### Role Mapping Validation
- **PM** = KERANI (creates transactions → Bunch Counter) ✅
- **P1** = MANDOR (verifies transactions → Conductor) ✅
- **P5** = ASISTEN (verifies transactions → Assistant) ✅

### Verification Logic
- **TRANSSTATUS = '704'** = Verified transactions ✅
- **Verification Rate** = (verified_count / total_receipts) * 100 ✅

## 📁 **Generated Reports**
